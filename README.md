# Message-Generator
Developing a messaging system bot, playing around with some concepts.  Basic code and functions written in typescript

# Core Function
Have placeholder greetings, salutations, core messages, etc.  Pull from a db/list of recipients that can be updated independently

# Nice to Haves, or for the Future...
DB of people that post messages at different variables, add a randomizer to the time periods, be able to scrape recent data from the net and based on user details generate a sentiment statement

# How to Run?
the messageGenerator.ts file has the main executable functions.  To run, open terminal and input 'node messageGenerator.js'.  If there have been recent additions or edits, executable code will have to be converted to javascript.  Use this command to convert the files before running 'node message_generator.js':

tsc message_generator.ts methods.ts; or tsc *
